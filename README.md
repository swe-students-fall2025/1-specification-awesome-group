## Stakeholders

### Stakeholder #1: Colin Chau (Junior at NYU)
I once sold my used textbooks at the NYU Bookstore and got only $4 for 3 books. I wanted to sell used textbooks because I wanted a way to get rid of books that I no longer need, but also be able to make some of the money back from purchasing them at retail pricing. I found it ridiculous that I was only able to get $4 back, and would love to sell my books on a NYU student-run app. This way, I can be assured that my textbooks will go to another student taking the same class, and I can have a say in the pricing of them too. 

### Stakeholder #2: Kaitlyn Chau (Recent NYU Graduate)
I had to buy a textbook through Facebook marketplace once, and I wish there was an app to facilitate course material selling in just the NYU community. I usually opt for finding free versions of textbooks online or buying it second hand, but it is usually hard to find. I feel like an app that is only for the NYU community means that transactions are a lot safer, and the chances that I will find a book that I need is higher. I would also be interested in posting listings of my old textbooks so they don’t take up space in my apartment. 

### Conclusion
Based on our interviews, here are some problems and goals we can identify from our stakeholders:  

**Problems:**
1. The NYU Bookstore is one of the few places that provides a buyback option for used textbooks, but the compensation is much lower than the original purchase price
2. General reselling platforms are accessible to anyone, which increases the risk of scams and unsafe transactions for students.
3. Other reselling platforms are not marketplaces dedicated to textbooks, which makes it hard for students to find specific books they are required to have for class. 
4. Without a dedicated platform for reselling textbooks, it is difficult for students to find textbooks at an affordable price, forcing them to either pay for the textbook at full price or spend a lot of time browsing on different platforms.  

**Goals:**
1. Having a platform that is exclusive to NYU students, so that textbook transactions can happen safely within the community.
2. Having a platform that is exclusive to the NYU campus, so transactions and meet ups can be easily coordinated on campus. 
3. Being able to negotiate the price of textbooks that they are reselling/purchasing.
4. To provide a marketplace where students can easily find the class materials they need, without searching across multiple platforms or paying high prices.
5. Foster a community environment where textbooks can be reused efficiently, reducing waste and costs for students.


## Product Vision Statement
Our app provides a secure marketplace exclusively for NYU students to buy, sell, or give away textbooks, making it easier to find course materials by class and professor while ensuring safer, community-based exchanges.
