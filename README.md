## Product Vision Statement
Our app provides a secure marketplace exclusively for NYU students to buy, sell, or give away textbooks and furniture, making it easier to find course materials by class and professor while ensuring safer, community-based exchanges.

## User Requirements
1. As an NYU student, I want to create a profile so that I can participate in buying, selling, and rating safely.
2. As a user, I want to post an item with details such as category, course number, and professor so that others can easily find what they need.
3. As a buyer, I want to search for textbooks by course number and professor so that I can quickly find relevant materials.
4. As a buyer, I want to filter search results by item category, price, or condition to find the best match for my needs.
5. As a user, I want to rate sellers on the quality of items, timeliness, and personality so that others can trust their listings.
6. As a seller, I want to view my posted items and edit or remove them as needed.
7. As a user, I want to message other users within the app to negotiate or ask questions about an item.
8. As a user, I want to receive notifications when someone messages me or when an item I'm interested in is updated.
9. As a user, I want to view other users' profiles and their ratings before deciding to buy or trade.
10. As a user, I want to report inappropriate or suspicious listings or users to maintain community safety.
