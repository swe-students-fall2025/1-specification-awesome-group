## Product Vision Statement
Our app provides a secure marketplace exclusively for NYU students to buy, sell, or give away textbooks and furniture, making it easier to find course materials by class and professor while ensuring safer, community-based exchanges.

## User Requirements
1. As a user, I want to create a profile so that I can participate in buying, selling, and rating safely.
2. As a user, I want to make sure that everyone in the app is a verified NYU student so that I can feel safer on the platform and be able to find closely related products.
3. As a user, I want to be able to change my profile so that I can present myself authentically and safely on the platform.
4. As a seller, I want to post an item with details such as category, course number, and professor so that potential buyers can find what they need.
5. As a user, I want to specify my pick-up/drop-off location so we can easily coordinate meet-ups for transactions.
6. As a buyer, I want to search for textbooks by course number and professor so that I can quickly find relevant materials.
7. As a buyer, I want to filter search results by item category, price, or condition so I can find the best match for my needs.
8. As a user, I want to rate each transaction so that I can provide feedback on each purchase to inform others.
9. As a buyer, I want to see the rating summary of each seller’s profile so I can evaluate the trustworthiness of the seller.
10. As a seller, I want to upload pictures of my textbooks so buyers can see what condition the course materials are.
11. As a seller, I want to be able to add descriptions of the course material so that I can provide more details for potential buyers.
12. As a buyer, I want to be able to add items to my wishlist so that I can keep track of the products that I’m interested in.
13. As a buyer, I want to be able to see my transaction history in my profile so that I can keep track of what I bought and who I bought it from.
14. As a seller, I want to show the prices of my products so that potential buyers are aware of how much I am expecting.
15. As a buyer, I want to be able to place a bid on a listing so that I can negotiate the price of the listing.
16. As a seller, I want to be able to place a counter bid so I can re-negotiate the price of the listing with the buyer. 
17. As a user, I want to message other users within the app to negotiate or ask questions about an item.
18. As a user, I want to receive notifications when someone messages me so I can connect with potential buyers/sellers as fast as possible. 
19. As a user, I want to receive notifications for new items that match my search criteria/wishlist so I can get product recommendations without having to actively search. 
20. As a user, I want to report inappropriate or suspicious listings or users to maintain community safety.
